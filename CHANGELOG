REG
===================================
- The explanation of a constellation model ("A constellation model is...") has been moved from section 3.3.1 to the end of section 3.1. The explanation has been expanded.
- A new figure (Figure 3.1) is added as an overview of the proposed approach. The old figure 3.1 becomes 3.2.

- Revised caption of figure 3.2 and figure 3.3
- Revised table 3.2 (old table 3.1)
	- Added table 3.3 which provides more information about the "range" of random pose
	- Added descriptions of K and Q in caption
	- Rotated the table format
- Added table 3.3
- Corrected figure 3.3
- Increase the size of figure 3.5
- For the method evaluated in fig 3.6, added brief introduction to Hough transform and it variants, \eg \cite{Woodford2013} and \cite{Barinova2010},  in the related work section.
- Revised the explanation of figure 3.6
- Limitations of the proposed method is discussed in the summary

ACTION
====================================
- Changed terminology: "look-ahead time" becomes "recognition latency"
- Redrawn figure 4.2 (Overview of the proposed approach).
- Revised the caption of figure 4.2
- Rewritten section 4.3 to describe figure 4.2 properly
- Revise figure 4.3 and its caption
- Revised section 4.4 to describe figure 4.3 properly
- In table 4.1,  "relative running time" is used instead of "relative speed", speedup factor is added to the table for reference.
- Redrawn figure 4.5 to describe the 3D histograms of the proposed HSRM algorithm.
- Revised the description for figure 4.5 in the text
- Added figure 4.6 to illustrate pyramid match kernel for the HSRM histogram.
- Added the description of figure 4.6 in the text. 
- Add limitations of the proposed action classification system.

BODY
====================================

HAND
====================================

- 6.2.1
	- Change "generative" and "discriminative" to "model-based" and "appearance-based" respectively, according to Erol 2007.
	- Change the order of sentences for smoother description in the "apeparance-based" method 
	- Minor editing

- 6.4.2
	- In subsection "Viewpoint classification term", reservoir sampling is explained (actually it is "random sampling without replacement"), \cite{Vitter1985} has been added as a reference.
	- Explained the adaptive switching paramters and how they affects the learning algorithm down the tree.
