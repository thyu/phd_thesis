DECLARATION
===================================
\item Changed "abstract" to "paper" in the declaration

INTRODUCTION
===================================
\item Revised figure 1.1
\item The thesis outline (section 1.2.3) has been extended

EVAL3d
===================================
\item Cosmetic improvements to Table 2.1, fixed missing table border in the first row
\item Cosmetic improvements to Table 2.2, reviewed the table headers
\item increased the size of figure 2.4
\item Revised the caption of figure 2.5, 2.6
\item Revised the format of Table 2.3, utilising the page width.

REG
===================================
\item The explanation of a constellation model ("A constellation model is...") has been moved from section 3.3.1 to the end of section 3.1. The explanation has been expanded.
\item A new figure (Figure 3.1) is added as an overview of the proposed approach. The old figure 3.1 becomes 3.2.

	- Added descriptions of K and Q in caption
	- Rotated the table format
\item Added table 3.3
\item Corrected figure 3.3
\item Increase the size of figure 3.5
\item Added implementation details of the Toshiba point cloud dataset used in the experiments.
\item For the method evaluated in fig 3.6, added brief introduction to Hough transform and it variants, \eg \cite{Woodford2013} and \cite{Barinova2010},  in the related work section.
\item Revised the explanation of figure 3.6

\item Added the description of figure 4.6 in the text.  - Add limitations of the proposed action classification system.  - Change the title of 4.7.2 from "Combined classification" to "Late fusion classificaiton"
\item Explained parameter $\alpha_c$ in the late fusion scheme

BODY
====================================
\item Re-designed figure 5.1
\item Removed the old figure 5.2 as it is not necessary in explaining the knowledge transfer ability of the proposed method.
\item Redrawn figure 5.2 (the overview) and revised its description in the text

\item Added figure 5.6 to show the joint names used in the experiment.

HAND
====================================
