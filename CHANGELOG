INTRODUCTION
===================================
- Revised figure 1.1

EVAL3d
===================================
- Cosmetic improvements to Table 2.1, fixed missing table border in the first row
- Cosmetic improvements to Table 2.2, reviewed the table headers
- increased the size of figure 2.4
- Revised the caption of figure 2.5, 2.6

REG
===================================
- The explanation of a constellation model ("A constellation model is...") has been moved from section 3.3.1 to the end of section 3.1. The explanation has been expanded.

	- Rotated the table format
- Added table 3.3
- Corrected figure 3.3
- Increase the size of figure 3.5
- Added implementation details of the Toshiba point cloud dataset used in the experiments.
- For the method evaluated in fig 3.6, added brief introduction to Hough transform and it variants, \eg \cite{Woodford2013} and \cite{Barinova2010},  in the related work section.
- Revised the explanation of figure 3.6
- Limitations of the proposed method is discussed in the summary

- Explained parameter $\alpha_c$ in the late fusion scheme

BODY
====================================
- Re-designed figure 5.1
- Removed the old figure 5.2 as it is not necessary in explaining the knowledge transfer ability of the proposed method.
