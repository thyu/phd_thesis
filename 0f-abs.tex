The recognition of three dimensional visual data is a fundamental problem in computer vision. 
Automatic 3D object recognition is becoming a vital part of a wide range of applications, such as robotics, human-computer interaction, activity analysis and video search. This thesis focuses on the sub-problems of 3D object recognition: \emph{classification} and \emph{pose estimation} of \emph{geometric shapes} and \emph{human actions} from 3D data, including voxels, point clouds, videos and depth image sequences.  

The main contributions of this work are various new practical solutions to the aforementioned tasks. 
It first introduces a performance evaluation of 3D interest point detectors used in existing 3D object recognition systems.  
Concerning 3D geometric shapes, this thesis proposes a novel, weakly-supervised constellation model that performs classification and registration simultaneously, without using pose information in training. This thesis also presents three different random forest-based algorithms for human action classification, 3D body pose estimation and 3D hand pose estimation respectively. 
A real-time action classification algorithm is proposed using semantic texton forest for efficient visual codeword extraction. By relating human actions and their poses, a novel approach is proposed to estimate 3D human pose in unconstrained, monocular videos. To this end, a hybrid random forest algorithm is designed to adaptively perform classification and regression in 3D visual data.   
Furthermore, a semi-supervised hand pose estimation approach is introduced by utilising both synthetic and realistic depth image sequences.
